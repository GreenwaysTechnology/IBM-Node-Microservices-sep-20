//how to read /write file using streams
//streams are powered events : evented io
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path');
const { log } = console;

const fileName = path.join(__dirname, 'assets/info.txt');
const config = {
    encoding: 'UTF-8'
}
//read stream
const inputStream = fs.createReadStream(fileName, config);

//data event is emitted by os for each chunk of data
let data = ''
inputStream.on('data', function (chunk) {
    log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`)
    data += chunk;
})

//end event is called , no more chunk of data is available.
inputStream.on('end', function () {
    log('There will be no more data to read!');
    log(data);
})

//error event: for error handling
inputStream.on('error', function (err) {
    log(`Some thing went wrong! ${err}`)
});
